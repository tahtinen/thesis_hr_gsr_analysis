# thesis_hr_gsr_analysis
Python scripts for processing, cleaning, and analyzing HR and GSR data collected from VR simulations as part of a thesis project.

**Collecting and Managing Physiological Data in Simulation Research  
– Implementation of a Secure Data Processing Workflow**

This repository contains scripts for a study conducted as part of the **AidVerse project**, where pairs of participants provided 
physiological data (GSR and HR) while taking part in simulations. 

An additional script generates **synthetic raw test data** using AI, designed to mimic iMotions-style CSV output files containing two participants’ GSR and HR data. GitHub Copilot was used to assist in writing the scripts.

## Pipeline Overview

1. **Create Test Data**
   - `generate_two_subjects_GSR_HR_data.py` – generates synthetic HR and GSR CSV data for two participants

2. **HR Processing**  
   - `hr_pre-processing.py` – first step in HR processing  
   - `hr_event_analysis.py` – second step in HR processing  
   - `hr_visualize.py` – optional additional step  

3. **GSR Processing**  
   - `eda_pre-processing.py` – first step in GSR processing  
   - `eda_event_analysis.py` – second step in GSR processing  
   - `eda_visualize.py` – optional additional step  

4. **Combine Data**  
   - `combine_data.py` – merges processed HR and GSR data into a single CSV file

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher  
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scipy`, `neurokit2`


## Next Steps / Future Work

The following steps remain to be completed as part of the AidVerse project:

- Automation of the data processing pipeline
- Precise localization of GSR events
- Accurate temporal/per-sample definition of event epochs
- Running the pipeline across all test participants
- Compilation of results and final data analysis
- Drawing conclusions based on the complete dataset
